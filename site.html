    <p>
      In the MMORPG game, Ragnarok M: Eternal Love, there are many unique jobs and are all listed here with some short explanations which can help you chose which job class you want to start as.
      This does not include the event collaboration jobs, since they were limited time, and you won't be able to choose to play them anymore.
      There might also be some new job classes that will be added into the game, and it might not be listed here.
