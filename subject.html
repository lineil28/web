    <h1> Ragnarok M Job Classes </h1>

    <ul>
      <li> Novice </li>
      <li> Swordsman </li>
      <li> Mage </li>
      <li> Thief </li>
      <li> Archer </li>
      <li> Acolyte </li>
      <li> Merchant </li>
      <li> Witch (Doram Race) </li>
    </ul>
<!-- Novice -->
    <h2> Novice </h2>

    <p>
      For those who don't wish to be shackled by a job class, you can choose to remain a novice.
      Getting there will be pretty hard because you won't have the skills of the job class that you chose not to be, so you only use short-ranged melee auto attacks.
    </p>

    <h3> Novice Branch </h3>

  <ul>
    <li> <a href="https://www.romcodex.com/job/1/" target="_blank"> Novice</a> </li>
      <ul>
        <li> <a href="https://www.romcodex.com/job/143/" target="_blank"> Advanced Novice</a> </li>
        <li> <a href="https://www.romcodex.com/job/144/" target="_blank"> Super Novice</a> (SuNo) </li>
        <li> <a href="https://www.romcodex.com/job/145/" target="_blank"> Novice Guardian</a> (NoGu) </li>
      </ul>
    <p>
      So when you achieve Base Level 80, you will be able to change your job into a Advanced Novice,
      where you will get some skills from all the other jobs. You will also be able to get a cart, which is unique to only novices and merchants.
      If you gave some specific skills from other jobs, it means that you get to choose to deal physical damage or magic damage.
      You will be able to upgrade your jobs after you get enough job levels, once you hit max job levels,
      you can advance to SuNo, with even more skills from all the other jobs and even some of your own unique skills.
      Super Novice isn't the last one, after you get even more job levels on your SuNo, you will be able to change your job to NoGu.
      And you guessed it, you even more skills, some borrowed from others and some unique to NoGu.
    </p>
  </ul>
<!-- Swordsman -->
    <h2> <a href="https://www.romcodex.com/job/11/" target="_blank"> Swordsman</a> </h2>

    <p>
      Unlike the Novice, all the other Human Race jobs will have 2 branches, with somewhat different playstyles.
      The swordsman, as the name implies, weilds a sword, which is a melee physical damage dealer, with very simple skills.
      Like the Novice and all later jobs, once you hit max job level of the job, you will be able to advance into a new one.
      This job class is a very special one, it is given a mount after it advances to the next job, and it doesn't matter which branch you choose, it is the earliest you are able to obtain your own permanent mount.
    </p>

    <h3> Swordsman Branches </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> <a href="https://www.romcodex.com/job/12/" target="_blank"> Knight</a> </li>
      <ul>
        <li> <a href="https://www.romcodex.com/job/13/" target="_blank"> Lord Knight</a> (LK) </li>
        <li> <a href="https://www.romcodex.com/job/14/" target="_blank"> Ruin Kight</a> (RK) </li>
        <li> <a href="https://www.romcodex.com/job/15/" target="_blank"> Runemaster</a> (RM) </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Of the two branches, the knight is more focused on damage. Knights skills are somewhat straight-forward, damage boosting skills.
        They are also given the ability to equip and use spears, some skills required swords or spears to be equipped and only one can be equipped a time.
      </p>
      <li> <a href="https://www.romcodex.com/job/72/" target="_blank">Crusader </li>
      <ul>
        <li> <a href="https://www.romcodex.com/job/73/" target="_blank"> Paladin</a> </li>
        <li> <a href="https://www.romcodex.com/job/74/" target="_blank"> Royal Guard</a> (RG) </li>
        <li> <a href="https://www.romcodex.com/job/75/" target="_blank"> Divine Avenger</a> (DA) </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The crusader, the second branch of the Swordsman is more focused on tanking, but they can also weild a sword or a spear.
        Something unique to the crusader is that they have skills which require a shield to be equipped to do damage,
        so even though the shield is in the off-hand slot, it is required for Paladins to have shields, for tanking or farming (for levels or loots).
      </p>
    </ul>
<!-- Mage -->
    <h2> <a href="https://www.romcodex.com/job/21/" target="_blank"> Mage</a> </h2>

    <p>
      Mages, as the name impies, deal magic damage. They can use staves, which aren't affected by size or element modifiers of the enemy they are attacking.
      They can use many skills and all the skills have forced elements, which means that the elemental damage of the skill can't be changed to deal more damage to the enemy,
      so they have to choose the right skills to use against different enemies.
    </p>

    <h3> Mage Branches </h3>

    <ul>
      <li> <a href="https://www.romcodex.com/job/22/" target="_blank"> Wizard</a> </li>
      <ul>
        <li> <a href="https://www.romcodex.com/job/23/" target="_blank"> High Wizard</a> (HW) </li>
        <li> <a href="https://www.romcodex.com/job/24/" target="_blank"> Warlock</a> (WL) </li>
        <li> <a href="https://www.romcodex.com/job/25/" target="_blank"> Arcane Master</a> (AM) </li>

      <p>
        Wizard class is a magic damage class, with insane burst damage and sustain damage. They have many different skills to manage and they have this skill which makes them immune to all damage except ghost element damage.
        What makes them so broken then? Can't everyone just make their attacks ghost element? No, there aren't many skills with ghost element damage, and only Warlocks have access to ghost element, but many people don't use it,
        so it makes them invincible for a short while, it has a somewhat long cooldown but every minute they can be invincible for a few second and in those few seconds, if there is an Earth Field (Sage Skill), they can completely wipe everyone in the vicinity,
        since thet have large aoe skills.
      </p>

      <li> <a href="https://www.romcodex.com/job/82/" target="_blank"> Sage</a> </li>

        <li> <a href="https://www.romcodex.com/job/85/" target="_blank"> Chronomancer</a> </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The sage job class is the only job class that can equip the weapon type, books. They also have special skills,
        called field spells, which stay on the floor for a while, and they have different effects, but there is one skill called earth field.
        Earth field is a skill which blocks the placements of other aoe/skills that required a selected location, if it is placed on the field.
        Sages can be a magic damage dealer, or they can even be a support sage, because they have a skill which can heal allies, and it is a field skill, so they can place and go to another place and it would still heal their allies.
      </p>
    </ul>
<!-- Thief -->
    <h2> <a href="https://www.romcodex.com/job/31/" target="_blank"> Thief</a> </h2>

      The thief job class is as its name applies, to be a thief, or be super sneaky.
      They are given the skill, Hide, which allows them to stay hidden and some of the skills do more damage if they cast it while hiding.
      If they attack using auto attacks or tagetted skills, their hiding is cancelled.

      Assassin are melee physical damage dealers but they also have some skills which can be casted from afar.
      Once you are a GX, you have a skill called poison smoke which can be used while hiding and it doesn't cancel it, because it is a field skill.
      It causes everyone in the smoke, not including allies of course, to be poisoned which causes them to lose health based on their max health which is somewhat very overpowered.

      Archers are given a falcon when they advance to Hunter. They have 3 different types of builds,

      All three of them uses bows but each of them are used in a different way. Hunters are given a skill which can reveal hiding enemies too.
      Once you become a ranger, you can also exchange your falcon for a wolf, called a Warg. It does exactly what a falcon can do,
      but with the new ranger skills, a Warg is required to use some of the skills, like Warf Rider, where you can ride your new wolf.
      Trappers are also useful against hiding enemies, since even though the person is hiding, they are still walking and if they walk onto a trap, it will activate/detonate.
    </p>

  </ul>

      Acolytes can be melee physical or ranged magic damage dealers, but they can also be healing supports.
      If you like to play melee physical damage with quick burst and retreat, then you can advance into monk.
      Healing and supporting is mainly the job of the Priest but they can also be melee phyical damage or ranged magical.
    </p>

        <li> <a href="https://www.romcodex.com/job/55/" target="_blank"> Saint</a> </li>
      </ul>
    <p>
      Priests are mainly focused on healing and buffing allies, they are given many skills to do that since they are the primary support class.
      They are also given holy damage skills, so it can farm by themselves, and don't have to rely on others.
      Even though they are the primary support class, they can also deal A LOT of damage by going Bonk Priest Build.
      Bonk Build is just the priests using melee auto attacks to kill monster, it doesn't sound strong but don't underestimate them.
      They are priests, they can buff themselves with the support skills and they have many passive skills which increase their auto attack damage.

    </ul>
    <p>
      Monks are melee burst damage, their main skill is a skill which depletes all your SP, and deals damage based on how much SP you have.
      This means that once you take an enemy out, you have to wait a while before you can do it again, since the skill you use blocks the use of items that restore SP for a while.
      They also have long ranged skills and melee auto attacks which is mostly used for farming monster.
    </p>
  </ul>
<!-- Merchant -->
    <h2> <a href="https://www.romcodex.com/job/61/" target="_blank"> Merchant</a> </h2>

    <p>
      Merchants are also somewhat unique, similar to the knights, they get something called a cart.
      It has an internal storage, which means you don't have to worry about having a full inventory.
      Some of their skills require a cart to be equipped to use it, and there are also passive skills which increase the carts storage or increase the damage you deal with cart skills.
    </p>

      </ul>
    <p>
      Blacksmiths are a physical damage dealer, and they can use axes and knives. Hammers are classified under axes, so don't be confused as to why blacksmiths don't have hammers.
      Also what is a blacksmith if they can't even craft any weapons or items. That being said, it means they can, only the blacksmith job can craft a few buffing items and a total of 8 unique weapons.
      They can all be sold on the Exchange, which is a player based economy market. When they become a mechanic they are also given the ability to pioneer a Madogear, which is basically a mech-suit.
      If you become even more advanced and become a lightbringer, it can control a Madogear without sitting in one, so it basically counts as two entities that can deal a lot of damage.
    </p>

    <li> <a href="https://www.romcodex.com/job/132/" target="_blank"> Alchemist</a> </li>
    <ul>

      like their main skill Hell Plant, where it costs a single plant bottle to spawn in a plant which stays on the ground for a while attacking all enemies.
    </p>
  </ul>


<!-- Doram -->
  <h2> <a href="https://www.romcodex.com/job/151/" target="_blank"> Witch</a> (Doram Race) </h2>

    <p>
      The Witch is the name of the starter Doram, they are a race of small cats, but unlike humans, you don't get to choose a different job class.
      Dorams are a race which communicates through spirits and the further they advance in jobs, the more spirits they can comminicate with, which just means that they get more skills.
      Even though can't choose different classes, there are three different playstyles for the doram, they have physical build, magic build, and they also have a support build.
    </p>

    </ul>
    <p>
      The three different playstyles of the doram include, insane aoe map control of the magic damage,
      super tanky but also deals a lot of damage because their damage scales off of their remaining health, or the super tanky support which can heal allies based on their max health.
      Dorams have a unique weapon type only they can use called fox grass, no idea how the developers came up with that but ok.
      There is a fox grass for each of the different playstyles.
    </p>
  </ul>
