          <li> <a href="https://www.romcodex.com/job/44/" target="_blank">Ranger</a> </li>
          <li> <a href="https://www.romcodex.com/job/45/" target="_blank">Stellar Hunter</a> (SH) </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Archers are given a falcon when they advance to Hunter. They have 3 different types of builds,
          they can use auto attacks (ADL build), they can also control the falcon (Beast Build), and they can also lay traps (Trapper Build).
          All three of them uses bows but each of them are used in a different way. Hunters are given a skill which can reveal hiding enemies too.
          Once you become a ranger, you can also exchange your falcon for a wolf, called a Warg. It does exactly what a falcon can do,
          but with the new ranger skills, a Warg is required to use some of the skills, like Warf Rider, where you can ride your new wolf.
          Trappers are also useful against hiding enemies, since even though the person is hiding, they are still walking and if they walk onto a trap, it will activate/detonate.

          The Bard or Dancer is the other branch but you can only be one, and you don't get to choose which one because it is decided by your gender.
          Bards can use a unique weapon type called an instrument, and Dancer can also use a unique weapon type called whips.
          They have many skills, some are solo performance skills, and some are ensemble or choir performance skills.
          Solo performance skills, as the name implies, can be used solo, and ensemble or choir skills require a partner of another gender.
          These performances are all an AoE affect that follows the caster. It can be used as a support class or a damage dealing class.
          Their skills can be used to buff allies, heal allies, or kill enemies.
