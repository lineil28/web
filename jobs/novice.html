    <h2> Novice </h2>

    <p>
      For those who don't wish to be shackled by a job class, you can choose to remain a novice.
      Getting there will be pretty hard because you won't have the skills of the job class that you chose not to be, so you only use short-ranged melee auto attacks.
    </p>

    <h3> Novice Branch </h3>

    <ul>

        <img src="../img/nogu.png" alt="text" id="t4pic">

      <li> <a href="https://www.romcodex.com/job/1/" target="_blank">Novice</a> </li>
      <ul>
        <li> <a href="https://www.romcodex.com/job/143/" target="_blank">Advanced Novice</a> </li>
        <li> <a href="https://www.romcodex.com/job/144/" target="_blank">Super Novice</a> (SuNo) </li>
        <li> <a href="https://www.romcodex.com/job/145/" target="_blank">Novice Guardian</a> (NoGu) </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        So when you achieve Base Level 80, you will be able to change your job into a Advanced Novice,
        where you will get some skills from all the other jobs. You will also be able to get a cart, which is unique to only novices and merchants.
        If you gave some specific skills from other jobs, it means that you get to choose to deal physical damage or magic damage.
        You will be able to upgrade your jobs after you get enough job levels, once you hit max job levels,
        you can advance to SuNo, with even more skills from all the other jobs and even some of your own unique skills.
        Super Novice isn't the last one, after you get even more job levels on your SuNo, you will be able to change your job to NoGu.
        And you guessed it, you even more skills, some borrowed from others and some unique to NoGu.
