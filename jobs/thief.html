        The thief job class is as its name applies, to be a thief, or be super sneaky.
        They are given the skill, Hide, which allows them to stay hidden and some of the skills do more damage if they cast it while hiding.
        If they attack using auto attacks or tagetted skills, their hiding is cancelled.

          Assassin are melee physical damage dealers but they also have some skills which can be casted from afar.
          Once you are a GX, you have a skill called poison smoke which can be used while hiding and it doesn't cancel it, because it is a field skill.
          It causes everyone in the smoke, not including allies of course, to be poisoned which causes them to lose health based on their max health which is somewhat very overpowered.
