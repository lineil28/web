      <p>
        Acolytes can be melee physical or ranged magic damage dealers, but they can also be healing supports.
        If you like to play melee physical damage with quick burst and retreat, then you can advance into monk.
        Healing and supporting is mainly the job of the Priest but they can also be melee phyical damage or ranged magical.

          Priests are mainly focused on healing and buffing allies, they are given many skills to do that since they are the primary support class.
          They are also given holy damage skills, so it can farm by themselves, and don't have to rely on others.
          Even though they are the primary support class, they can also deal A LOT of damage by going Bonk Priest Build.
          Bonk Build is just the priests using melee auto attacks to kill monster, it doesn't sound strong but don't underestimate them.
          They are priests, they can buff themselves with the support skills and they have many passive skills which increase their auto attack damage.

          Monks are melee burst damage, their main skill is a skill which depletes all your SP, and deals damage based on how much SP you have.
          This means that once you take an enemy out, you have to wait a while before you can do it again, since the skill you use blocks the use of items that restore SP for a while.
          They also have long ranged skills and melee auto attacks which is mostly used for farming monster.
