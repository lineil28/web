      <p>
        The Witch is the name of the starter Doram, they are a race of small cats, but unlike humans, you don't get to choose a different job class.
        Dorams are a race which communicates through spirits and the further they advance in jobs, the more spirits they can comminicate with, which just means that they get more skills.
        Even though can't choose different classes, there are three different playstyles for the doram, they have physical build, magic build, and they also have a support build.
      </p>

        <li> <a href="https://www.romcodex.com/job/152/" target="_blank">Spiritualist</a> </li>
        <ul>
          <li> <a href="https://www.romcodex.com/job/153/" target="_blank">Summoner</a> </li>
          <li> <a href="https://www.romcodex.com/job/154/" target="_blank">Spirit Summoner</a> </li>
          <li> <a href="https://www.romcodex.com/job/155/" target="_blank">Spirit Whisperer</a> </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The three different playstyles of the doram include, insane aoe map control of the magic damage,
          super tanky but also deals a lot of damage because their damage scales off of their remaining health, or the super tanky support which can heal allies based on their max health.
          Dorams have a unique weapon type only they can use called fox grass, no idea how the developers came up with that but ok.
          There is a fox grass for each of the different playstyles.
