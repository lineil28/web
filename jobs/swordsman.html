      <p>
        Unlike the Novice, all the other Human Race jobs will have 2 branches, with somewhat different playstyles.
        The swordsman, as the name implies, weilds a sword, which is a melee physical damage dealer, with very simple skills.
        Like the Novice and all later jobs, once you hit max job level of the job, you will be able to advance into a new one.
        This job class is a very special one, it is given a mount after it advances to the next job, and it doesn't matter which branch you choose, it is the earliest you are able to obtain your own permanent mount.
      </p>

      <h3> Swordsman Branches </h3>
      <ul>

        <div id="centerpic">
          <img src="../img/rm.png" alt="text" id="t4pic">
        </div>

        <li> <a href="https://www.romcodex.com/job/12/" target="_blank">Knight</a> </li>
        <ul>
          <li> <a href="https://www.romcodex.com/job/13/" target="_blank">Lord Knight</a> (LK) </li>
          <li> <a href="https://www.romcodex.com/job/14/" target="_blank">Ruin Kight</a> (RK) </li>
          <li> <a href="https://www.romcodex.com/job/15/" target="_blank">Runemaster</a> (RM) </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Of the two branches, the knight is more focused on damage. Knights skills are somewhat straight-forward, damage boosting skills.
          They are also given the ability to equip and use spears, some skills required swords or spears to be equipped and only one can be equipped a time.
        </p>

        <li> <a href="https://www.romcodex.com/job/72/" target="_blank">Crusader </li>
        <ul>
          <li> <a href="https://www.romcodex.com/job/73/" target="_blank">Paladin</a> </li>
          <li> <a href="https://www.romcodex.com/job/74/" target="_blank">Royal Guard</a> (RG) </li>
          <li> <a href="https://www.romcodex.com/job/75/" target="_blank">Divine Avenger</a> (DA) </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The crusader, the second branch of the Swordsman is more focused on tanking, but they can also weild a sword or a spear.
          Something unique to the crusader is that they have skills which require a shield to be equipped to do damage,
          so even though the shield is in the off-hand slot, it is required for Paladins to have shields, for tanking or farming (for levels or loots).
