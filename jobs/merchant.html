      <p>
        Merchants are also somewhat unique, similar to the knights, they get something called a cart.
        It has an internal storage, which means you don't have to worry about having a full inventory.
        Some of their skills require a cart to be equipped to use it, and there are also passive skills which increase the carts storage or increase the damage you deal with cart skills.

          Blacksmiths are a physical damage dealer, and they can use axes and knives. Hammers are classified under axes, so don't be confused as to why blacksmiths don't have hammers.
          Also what is a blacksmith if they can't even craft any weapons or items. That being said, it means they can, only the blacksmith job can craft a few buffing items and a total of 8 unique weapons.
          They can all be sold on the Exchange, which is a player based economy market. When they become a mechanic they are also given the ability to pioneer a Madogear, which is basically a mech-suit.
          If you become even more advanced and become a lightbringer, it can control a Madogear without sitting in one, so it basically counts as two entities that can deal a lot of damage.

          The alchemists, can also equip axes and knives, but they have a skill unique to only alchemist, called summon homunculus.
          They can summon 4 unique homunculus but only one at a time. Each homunculus gives different buffs or has different uses.
          They can also produce potions or effect bottles. Effect bottles are required to use some of their skills,
          like their main skill Hell Plant, where it costs a single plant bottle to spawn in a plant which stays on the ground for a while attacking all enemies.
